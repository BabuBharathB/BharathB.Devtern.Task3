 Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression


1. Data Preprocessing:
The dataset (Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv) is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Missing values are handled by dropping rows with any NaN values.
Data visualization techniques like histograms are used to understand the distribution of features.
The dataset is split into features (X) and target variable (y).
Standardization (normalization) is applied to scale the features.


2. Logistic Regression Model:
Logistic regression is chosen as the predictive model.
The model is trained on the training set (X_train, y_train) and then tested on the test set (X_test, y_test).
The logistic regression model is instantiated using LogisticRegression() from scikit-learn and trained using fit().


3. Model Evaluation:
Accuracy of the model is calculated using accuracy_score.
Confusion matrix and classification report are generated to evaluate the model's performance.
Metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value,
positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio are calculated.


4. Insights:
Model coefficients (or weights) are not explicitly examined in your code. However,
understanding the coefficients can provide insights into feature importance.
Feature importance can be inferred from the magnitude and sign of the coefficients.
Features with higher absolute coefficients contribute more to the prediction.
